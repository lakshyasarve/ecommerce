<div className="policies-spacer"></div>
<h5>SECTION 12 - LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h5>
<h6>12.1  PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY SINCE IT LIMITS THE LIABILITY OF CULT GAIA TO YOU. 
YOU HEREBY AGREE THAT:

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR USE OF THE SITE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY INFORMATION YOU SEND OR RECEIVE DURING YOUR USE OF THE SITE MAY NOT BE SECURE AND MAY BE INTERCEPTED BY UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND THAT THE SITE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU AT NO CHARGE. RECOGNIZING SUCH,
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER CULT GAIA NOR ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, OR THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHER DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE SITE, OR ANY OTHER SITE YOU ACCESS THROUGH A LINK FROM THIS SITE OR FROM ANY ACTIONS WE TAKE OR FAIL TO TAKE AS A RESULT OF COMMUNICATIONS YOU SEND TO US, OR THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, OR FOR ANY
INFORMATION, PRODUCTS, OR SERVICES ADVERTISED IN OR OBTAINED THROUGH THE SITE, CULT GAIA’S REMOVAL OR DELETION OF ANY MATERIALS SUBMITTED OR POSTED ON ITS SITE, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE SITE, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF CULT GAIA, ITS AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES. THIS DISCLAIMER APPLIES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TO ANY DAMAGES OR INJURY ARISING FROM ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DELETION, DEFECTS, DELAY IN

BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, ALL OR A PORTION OF THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

12.2  For residents of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and any other country in the European Economic Area, please read the following items carefully: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing:

- your claim(s) for damages are excluded, except for such claims for damages arising from injury to life, body, health or from the breach of essential contractual obligations (cardinal obligations) and except
for liability for other damages based on an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by Cult Gaia, its legal representatives, employees or vicarious agents. Material contractual obligations are those whose fulfillment is necessary to achieve the goal of the contract.

- In the event of a breach of material contractual obligations, Cult Gaia shall only be liable for the foreseeable damage typical for the type of contract if such damage was caused by simple negligence, unless the damage claims are based on injury to life, body or health.

- The limitations of liability shall also apply in favor of the legal representatives, employees and vicarious agents of the Company if claims are asserted directly against them.

- Any applicable mandatory statutory provisions remain unaffected.</h6>

<div className="policies-spacer"></div>
<h5>SECTION 13 - INDEMNIFICATION</h5>
<h6>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless CULT GAIA and our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, agents, contractors, licensors, service providers, subcontractors, suppliers, interns and employees, from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, expenses, damages, and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs, arising or resulting from your use of the Site and any violation of these Terms of Use. If you cause a technical disruption of the Site or the systems transmitting the Site to you or others, you agree to be responsible for any and all losses, liabilities, expenses, damages, and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs, arising or resulting from that disruption. Cult Gaia reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume
exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and, in such case, you agree to cooperate with Cult Gaia in the defense of such matter.</h6>

<div className="policies-spacer"></div>
<h5>SECTION 14 - DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</h5>
<h6>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT

14.1  Informal Dispute Resolution. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case.  Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. For any dispute relating to these Terms, you agree to first contact us at hello@cultgaia.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. Your notice of dispute must be individual to you and must include, as applicable, your name, your email address, and your residential address. The notice of
dispute also must explain the facts of the dispute as you understand them and tell us what you want us to do to resolve the issue. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, and you agree that a notice of dispute containing all of
the information required above, followed by at least 60 days of good faith negotiation, are preconditions to either party initiating a lawsuit or
arbitration. A notice of dispute will not be valid unless it contains all of
the information required by this paragraph. If you commence an arbitration without having previously provided a valid and compliant notice of dispute, you
and we agree that the applicable arbitration provider (or the arbitrator, if one has been appointed) must suspend the arbitration pending compliance with
this paragraph. You and we authorize the arbitration provider or the arbitrator to decide summarily whether the party that commenced an arbitration complied with these notice requirements, relying solely on these  Terms and the notice of dispute provided (if any). All statutes of limitation shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph.

14.2  We Both Agree to Arbitrate. In the unlikely event that we do not reach an agreed upon solution within sixty (60) days from the date the informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the Initial Dispute Resolution section above, then unless an Exception applies as
stated below, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, including but not limited to its formation, performance, breach or alleged breach thereof, and regardless of whether the dispute is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, or tort (collectively, “Claims”), by binding
arbitration.

You and Cult Gaia  agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms, or your receipt of text messages from Cult Gaia, or anyone sending text messages on Cult Gaia’s behalf, including but not limited to, its service providers, through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate Cult Gaia’s intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade
secret, copyright, or patent rights). Under such circumstances Cult Gaia may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the website, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.

14.3  What Is Arbitration: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief
that a court can. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found
unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.

14.4 Arbitration Procedures. The parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of the Federal Judicial Circuit in which Cult Gaia’s principle place of business is
located, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Within ten (10) calendar days after the arbitration demand is served upon a party, the parties must jointly select an arbitrator with at least five years’ experience in that capacity and who has knowledge of and experience with the subject matter of the dispute.  If the parties do not agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) calendar days, a party may petition the AAA to appoint an arbitrator, who must satisfy the same experience requirement. In the event of a dispute, the arbitrator shall decide the enforceability and interpretation of this arbitration agreement in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”).  The parties also agree that the AAA’s rules governing Emergency Measures of Protection shall apply in lieu of seeking emergency injunctive relief from a court. Each party shall bear its share of the fees paid for the arbitrator and the administration of the arbitration; however, the arbitrator shall have the power to order one party to pay all or any portion of such fees as part of a well-reasoned decision.  The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to award attorneys’ fees only to the extent
expressly authorized by statute or contract. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration without the prior written consent of both parties, unless to protect or pursue a legal right. If any term or provision of this Section is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Section or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction.  If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the parties hereby waive any right to a jury trial.  This arbitration provision shall survive any cancellation or termination of your agreement to participate in any of our Programs.

14.5 Authority of Arbitrator: The arbitrator will decide the rights and
liabilities, if any, of you and Cult Gaia, and the dispute will not be
consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages and each party hereby waives any right to seek or recover punitive damages with respect to any dispute resolved by arbitration. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The decision of the arbitrator shall be
final and binding, and no party shall have rights of appeal except for those provided in section 10 of the FAA.

14.6 No Class Actions. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION OR COLLECTIVE ACTION OR CLASS
ARBITRATION.

14.7  Exception—Mass Arbitration Before NAM. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to have arbitrations administered by AAA, in the event 25 or more demands for arbitration are filed relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact, and counsel for the parties submitting the demands are the same or coordinated, you and we agree that the demands will constitute a “Mass Arbitration.” If a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and we agree that it shall be administered by National Arbitration & Mediation (“NAM”), a nationally recognized arbitration provider, and governed by the NAM rules in effect when the Mass
Arbitration is filed as modified by these Terms, including the NAM Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules, but excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (collectively, the “NAM Rules”). The NAM Rules are available at www.namadr.com or by calling 1-800-358-2550. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, you and we agree that if either party fails or refuses to commence the Mass Arbitration before NAM, you or we may seek an order from a court of competent jurisdiction compelling compliance
with this agreement and compelling administration of the Mass Arbitration before NAM. Pending resolution of any such requests to a court, you and we agree that all arbitrations comprising the Mass Arbitration (and any obligation
to pay arbitration fees) shall be stayed. You and we acknowledge that either party’s failure to comply with this paragraph would irreparably harm the other, and you and we agree that a court may issue an order staying the arbitrations (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) until any disagreements over the provisions of this paragraph are resolved by the court.

14.8  Waiver of Jury Trial.  THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Sephora in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND CULT GAIA WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.

14.9  30 Day Right to Opt-Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out by emailing us at hello@cultgaia.com, and providing the following information: (i) your name, (ii) your email address; (iii) your mailing address; and (iv) a statement of your wish not to resolve disputes with Cult Gaia through arbitration.  The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of a Program following the effective date of these Terms; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. If you opt-out of these
arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.

14.10 Term for Cause of Action. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of any Program or these Terms must be filed within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

14.11 Forum. To the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth above do not apply or if you have opted out of arbitration, you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California, and you and we agree that any litigation shall be
filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside). In the event of litigation not subject to these Terms to binding arbitration, you and we agree to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any right to bring a class action or any right to a jury
trial, except where a class action or jury trial waiver is not permissible
under applicable law.</h6>

<h5>SECTION 16 - SEVERABILITY</h5>
