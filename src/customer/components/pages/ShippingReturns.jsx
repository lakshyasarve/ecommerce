      HOW FAST IS YOUR SHIPPING?
Most of our orders are shipped 1-3 days from purchase pending availability and credit verification. Once your order is shipped, we estimate you will receive your order within 5-7 business days of its ship date. If you need your item(s) sooner, please select the expedited shipping option. Shipping times may vary, but rest assured we work our hardest to get you your order as quickly as possible. Effective March 25, 2020, DHL services are operating at a slightly reduced capacity due to airline reductions. Please note that international shipments will arrive 2-3 days later than normal. We reserve the right to cancel orders due to shipping restrictions in place worldwide. Customer service will notify you if this cancellation occurs. Shipping costs are nonrefundable. We are unable to ship to PO Box and military addresses. Cult Gaia is not responsible for packages once they have been scanned and delivered.

HOW LONG DOES INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING TAKE?
Orders placed before noon PST will generally ship 1-3 business day via DHL Express. Effective March 25, 2020, DHL services are operating at a slightly reduced capacity due to airline reductions. Please note that international shipments will arrive 2-3 days later than normal. If you need to place an order for rush shipment please contact us at orders@cultgaia.com.  If for any reason your order is to be delayed or cancelled - due to stock, payment or otherwise - we will contact you via email. 

HOW MUCH DUTIES AND TAXES WILL I HAVE TO PAY?
Prices displayed on our website do not include taxes and duties.

Starting on July 25, 2019, Cult Gaia is partnering with Global-E to ship orders outside of the United States Delivery Duty Paid (DDP). Duties and taxes to your respective country will be displayed as a separate line item in your Check Out cart. All duties paid at check out are not collected by Cult Gaia; they are passed directly to your local customs office.

(Note - All orders placed through July 24, will be shipped Delivery Duty Unpaid (DDU). Once your order is shipped, the carrier will bill you to pay all import duties, customs and local sales taxes levied by the country you are shipping to.)

Currently, all International orders are FINAL SALE and may not be returned or exchanged. Cult Gaia is not responsible for international shipments lost in transit. 

CAN I CHANGE MY SHIPPING METHOD?
Once your package has been shipped out and handed to the respective courier, you cannot change the shipping method.
